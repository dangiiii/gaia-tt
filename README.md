# Investment Tech Tree

An interactive visualization platform for exploring energy technology development pathways and investment opportunities. This web application provides a comprehensive view of various energy sectors - including Nuclear (fusion and fission), Fossil Fuels and their enabling technologies, core concepts, and key milestones.

## Project Purpose

The Investment Tech Tree serves as a decision-support tool for investors, researchers, and policymakers in the nuclear energy sector. It visualizes the complex relationships between different technologies, their current Technology Readiness Levels (TRL), and the critical milestones needed to advance toward commercial nuclear power.

The platform features a full CRUD interface for editing the technology tree, AI-powered document analysis for suggesting improvements, and integration with MongoDB for persistent data storage.

## Key Features

### Interactive Technology Graph

- **Visual Technology Mapping**: Interactive graph showing fusion reactor concepts, enabling technologies, and milestones
- **Technology Readiness Levels**: Current and projected TRL tracking for each technology node
- **Relationship Visualization**: Clear depiction of dependencies and connections between technologies
- **Node Highlighting**: Interactive selection with connected element highlighting

### AI-Powered Chat Interface

- **Contextual Assistance**: Chat is proxied to the kg-service, where `qwen3.8:27b` (Ollama) answers with an agentic loop — it calls KG tools (entity resolution, concept expansion, paper dossiers, vector search over paper chunks, guarded read-only Cypher) and cites papers by id
- **Technology Queries**: Ask questions about specific technologies, milestones, or investment opportunities
- **Persistent History**: Chat history saved locally for continuity

### Literature Overlay & Curation

- **Literature nodes**: Nodes enriched by the KG show a book icon — papers, fusion devices and findings materialized from Neo4j into MongoDB (`enrich.py`), so no live KG connection is needed at runtime
- **Overview/Focused modes**: Focused mode isolates a node with its literature context; edge labels and kind-colored edges are toggleable
- **Voting**: Users can thumb up/down devices and findings on the nodes, and papers + individual experiments in the paper details modal — tallies surface in the review UI
- **Review Literature**: Admin-gated curation panel — filter by accepted/rejected and manual/AI origin, see vote tallies and LLM rejection reasons, and accept/reject items (including individual paper experiments). Human verdicts persist across enrichment rebuilds.

### Administrative Features

- **Edit Mode**: Password-protected interface for modifying the technology tree
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete nodes and edges
- **Real-time Updates**: Changes are immediately saved to MongoDB
- **Graph Editing**: Add or remove connections between technologies
- **TRL Management**: Update technology readiness levels based on new evidence

### InFact Analysis Integration

- **TRL Verification**: Automated analysis of technology readiness levels
- **Uncertainty Metrics**: Probability and uncertainty measurements for TRL assessments
- **Detailed Reports**: Full analysis reports with evidence and interpretation
- **Interactive Visualization**: View complete analysis in embedded HTML reports

- npm or yarn package manager
- MongoDB Atlas Account (https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)

### Database Setup

- Sign up at https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas
- Create a new free cluster
- Note your cluster connection details
- Run following script to set-up the nuclear db: `npx tsx --env-file=.env.local scripts/add-nuclear-data.ts`
- You can also add fossil fuel db: `npx tsx --env-file=.env.local scripts/add-fossil-fuel-data.ts`

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd gaia-tt
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Setup**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT=development
   MONGODB_URI=your_tech_tree_db_connection_string
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_admin_password_here
   KG_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8080   # kg-service (chat), e.g. forwarded 22333
   KG_API_KEY=your_shared_kg_service_key
   VOTE_SECRET=any_long_random_string     # signs anonymous voter cookies
   ```

4. **Start development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Access the application**
   Open <http://localhost:3000/investment-tech-tree> in your browser

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT` | Environment mode (development/production) | Yes |
| `MONGODB_URI` | Connection string for DB | Yes |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Admin PWD for TT Edits and literature curation | Yes |
| `KG_SERVICE_URL` | Base URL of the kg-service (chat backend), e.g. `http://localhost:22333` | For chat |
| `KG_API_KEY` | Shared key sent as `X-API-Key` to the kg-service | For chat |
| `VOTE_SECRET` | HMAC key signing anonymous voter cookies (any long random string) | For voting |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Legacy — chat now uses the kg-service; safe to drop | No |

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

### Remote Services via SSH Port Forwarding

For local development, the knowledge-graph backend services (Neo4j and Ollama) run on the remote `aconcagua` host on non-standard ports. Forward them to their standard local ports so local tools and services can reach them on `localhost`:

```bash
ssh -L 7474:localhost:7475 -L 7687:localhost:7688 -L 11434:localhost:11437 -L 22333:localhost:22333 <host>
```

| Local port | Service | Remote port (`aconcagua server`) |
|------------|---------|---------------------|
| 7474 | Neo4j Browser (HTTP) | 7475 |
| 7687 | Neo4j Bolt | 7688 |
| 11434 | Ollama API | 11437 |
| 22333 | kg-service API | 22333 |

Keep the SSH session open while developing. You can verify the Ollama endpoint with `scripts/check_ollama.sh`.

> **Note on LLMs:** Chat is served by the kg-service (`fusion_kg_builder` repo, `service/kg_service.py` — FastAPI + bounded agentic loop over `qwen3.8:27b` on Ollama, with KG tools incl. read-only Cypher and vector search). For chat-only use, forwarding `22333` suffices and `KG_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:22333`. The literature overlay does not need any forwarding — it reads materialized `kg_*` collections from MongoDB.

### Code Quality

The project uses automated code quality tools:

- **ESLint**: JavaScript/TypeScript linting
- **Prettier**: Code formatting
- **lint-staged**: Pre-commit hooks for code quality

### Data Management

All technology tree data is stored in MongoDB Atlas. To modify the tech tree:

**Using the Edit Interface:**
   - Click "Edit Tree" in the main interface
   - Enter the admin password (set in `ADMIN_PASSWORD`)
   - Use the edit interface to:
     - Add new nodes with required connections
     - Edit existing node properties
     - Delete nodes (removes connected edges automatically)
     - Add or remove edges between nodes
   - Changes are saved immediately to MongoDB

**Using the AI Assistant:**
   - Upload research papers or technical documents
   - AI analyzes content and suggests additions/modifications
   - Review suggestions and manually apply via Edit Interface

## Deployment

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

### Static Export

The application can be exported as static files:

```bash
npm run build
# Static files will be in the 'out' directory
```

## Mobile support

The application is optimized for desktop and tablet devices. Mobile phone users will see a warning dialog recommending desktop usage for the best experience. However, the application is functional on mobile with responsive adaptations:

- Toggle buttons for showing/hiding legend and options
- Collapsible panels and controls
- Touch-friendly interface elements
- Simplified navigation

## Adding a New Dataset

Follow these steps to add a new dataset (e.g., a Solar Tech Tree) and fully integrate it into the app.

1. **Prepare the Data Source**
   - Create a JSON data file (e.g., `data/solar_tech_tree.json`) containing nodes and edges.
   - Ensure nodes include required properties like `id`, `label`, `type`, and `trl_current`.

2. **Create and Run a Database Seed Script**
   - Add a script in `scripts/` (e.g., `scripts/add-solar-data.ts`) following the existing fossil/nuclear patterns.
   - Update `JSON_FILE_PATH` to your new JSON file and set a new `DB_NAME` (e.g., `solar_tt_db`).
   - Run the script:
     ```bash
     npx tsx --env-file=.env.local scripts/add-solar-data.ts
     ```

3. **Update Node Types and Styling (`src/lib/types.ts`)**
   - Add new node types to `NODE_LABELS` (e.g., `SolarConcept`).
   - Assign Tailwind CSS color classes in `LABEL_COLORS`.
   - Add corresponding entries to `LABEL_COLORS_VARIABLES` so they render correctly.

4. **Register the Topic Configuration (if present, e.g., `src/lib/topicConfig.ts`)**
   - Add your new topic to the `TopicKey` union.
   - Add a new entry in `TOPICS` with `id`, `label`, `dbName`, and a tailored `systemPrompt`.

5. **API Routing Integration**
   - If your API route reads a `topic` query param and maps to `topicConfig.dbName`, no additional fetch changes are needed.
